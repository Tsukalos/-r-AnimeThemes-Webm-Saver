If you have any suggestions or want to help in some way, feel free to contact me: <b><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Pedrowski/">/u/Pedrowski</a></b>

**Note** : Japanese characters (all unicode non-ascii) are removed from string, although I don't find this procedure right...

As for now you need to have <b><a href="https://praw.readthedocs.org/en/stable/">praw</a></b> in your python library. 

If some domain don't allow you to download the files, please let me know.

This has only been tested on version 3.5.1 of python.

If the japanese character aren't showing properly in the logs, set your system locale to japanese, or simply use 
a better text editor ( I recommend [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) )

## Installing Praw
Praw is easily installed using [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)

`pip install praw`
